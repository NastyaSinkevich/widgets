I have been working with Angular for over five years, but when presented with the opportunity to explore Vue.js through a given test task, I found it intriguing to venture into Vue.js development.

This project is my attempt to implement the specified functionality using Vue.js. Keep in mind that this represents my initial exposure to Vue.js (or what I learned within a week during my free time).

Features
I've implemented the basic functionality as outlined in the test task, striving to familiarize myself with Vue.js concepts. The project incorporates fundamental features, but I acknowledge that there is room for improvement and refinement.

Key Points
My favourite part: The thing that I really like in my project is working with contrasts and colors of the text and background of the badge dynamically.
Learning Curve: Transitioning from Angular to Vue.js has been an exciting learning experience.
Testing: I've included minimal unit tests to ensure basic functionality.
Storybook: Basic Storybook integration is added for component visualization.
